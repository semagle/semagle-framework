# Semagle: F# Framework for Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing

Semagle F# Framework is a demonstration of the idea that machine learning and natural language processing 
problems can be productively solved using F# language. At the current stage, it is hard to achieve even the 
2x performance of the C code, but .NET runtime and F# compiler are improving. Thus, we might expect 
that the performance will improve over the time.
